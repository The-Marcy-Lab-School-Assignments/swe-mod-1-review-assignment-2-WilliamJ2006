# Short Responses

For this short response assignment, aim to write a response with the following qualities (your instructor will give you feedback on these areas):

- [] Addresses all parts of the prompt
- [] Accurately uses relevant technical terminology
- [] Is free of grammar and spelling mistakes (double check with grammarly!)
- [] Uses markdown to enhance readability (preview in VS Code with Command/Control + Shift + V)
- [] Is easy to comprehend

For each prompt below, write your response in the space provided. Aim to answer each prompt in 2-5 concise sentences. Make sure to preview your markdown to check how it is rendered before submitting.

## Prompt 1

Read the following code:

```js
const playlist1 = { name: "My Favorites", songCount: 10 };
const playlist2 = playlist1;
playlist2.songCount = 15;
console.log(playlist1.songCount);
```

Part A: What will be logged to the console? Why?

Part B: How would you modify the code so that reassigning `playlist2.songCount` does NOT affect `playlist1`.songCount? Write the corrected code below your response (we've provided the broken code again for you to fix).

### Response 1

**Corrected Code:**

```js
// fix this!
const playlist1 = { name: "My Favorites", songCount: 10 };
const playlist2 = { ...playlist1 };
playlist2.songCount = 15;
console.log(playlist1.songCount);
```

## Prompt 2

```js
const students = [
  { name: "Maya", grade: 92, passed: true },
  { name: "Jamal", grade: 78, passed: true },
  { name: "Destiny", grade: 88, passed: true },
  { name: "Marcus", grade: 95, passed: true },
];
```

For each task below, identify which array method (forEach, filter, map, find, or reduce) you would use.

## Prompt 3

```js
const letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
const capitalize = (str) => str.toUpperCase();

const upperCaseLetters = letters.map(capitalize());
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')

console.log(upperCaseLetters);
```

### Response 3

## Prompt 4

Given this code:

```js
const orders = [
  { id: 1, total: 45 },
  { id: 2, total: 23 },
  { id: 3, total: 67 },
];

const grandTotal = orders.reduce((sum, order) => {
  return sum + order.total;
}, 0);
```

- Part A: What will `grandTotal` equal after this code runs?
- Part B: Explain what the `0` at the end of the reduce method does. Why is it important?
- Part C: Walk through what happens in the FIRST iteration of reduce:
  - What is the value of sum?
  - What is the value of order?
  - What gets returned?d
